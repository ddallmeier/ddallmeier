## About me 

I am a computational neuroscientist with a passion for using data science techniques to study the brain and its diseases. I have experience in Python, R, and statistics, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills.

## My Skills

- **Python**: I have experience in using Python for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. I am proficient in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow, and Scikit-learn.
- **R**: I have experience in using R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. I am proficient in packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and lme4.
- **Statistics**: I have a strong background in statistics, with a focus on statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data analysis. I have experience in using statistical methods for neuroscience research.


## Projects
A selection of projects. 

### Data Science & Machine Learning
| Project  | Description | Implementation | Dataset | Date |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Alzheimer's Disease Pathology (IDSC Fellowship) | Utilization of supervised and unsupervised machine learning for Alzheimer's Disease research. [Launch Event](https://idsc.miami.edu/idsc-fellows-capstone-2022/) & [Capstone Presentation](https://idsc.miami.edu/2021-2022-idsc-fellows-capstone/) | [Python](https://github.com/ddallmeier/IDSC-Fellowship-2022/blob/main/IDSC_Full_Presentation.pdf) | Neuropathology dataset | 05/2022 |
| Blood Biomarker Assessment | I developed a machine learning models to determine the importanace of blood biomarkers following traumatic brain injury. I used Python and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. | [Python](https://github.com/ddallmeier/TBI-Blood-Biomarkers/blob/main/TBI_Biomarker.ipynb) | Blood Antibody dataset | 02/2019 |

### Data Visualization
| Project  | Description | Implementation | Dataset | Date |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Stock Samurai | I developed a WebApp to visualize stock market data. Includes sustainability measures, stock charts with bollinger bands, and investment bank recommendations. | [Python, HTML, Markdown](https://github.com/ddallmeier/stockSamurai) | Stock Financial data | 11/2022 |d

### App Development
| Project  | Description | Implementation | Dataset | Date |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Digital Biomarker Generation and Analysis | I developed an app to record stimulus and self paced movements and performed pattern analysis to generate digital biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. I used java to create the front end and back end of the android app and Matlab and Python to analyze the data and evaluate scientific significance. | [Java](https://github.com/ddallmeier/Digital-Biomarkers/tree/main/src) & Matlab | App generated data | 06/2018 |
